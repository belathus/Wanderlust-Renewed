    # The disco ball's beams have a bounce/reflecting limit of 4 times. This is to prevent tps drops. This number is kind of a sweet spot in an enclosed cube of reflective alloy blocks. If you set it to a higher value, it will reflect a lot more beams but will drop your tps if you cannot handle it.
